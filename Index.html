    <h1>Everything Everywhere All At Ocnce</h1>

    <p>My name is Brenda, I was born on a warm, sunny day in January in Nicaragua. Maybe it was warm and sunny - who knows. My parents were Bob and Ines, they are both deceased. I grew up in Florida with my aunt and cousin. Things were different back then and time seemed to go slower. I joined the military right out of highschool becasue we didn't have much money to pay for school. I retired out of the military early due to an injury that couldn't be fixed. I've deployed many times and seen and learned about so many different cultures.</p>

    <h2>Who I am in life</h2>
    <P><b>I am a storyteller.</b> I like to write fictional stories. For example: A group of people have allegedly been killed in a battle with time traveling dinasours.</P>


    <h3><i>Is this a true story</i></h3>
    <ins> <p><del><Mark>Correction:</mark> My story originally reported that a group of people were killed in a dinosaur battle while time travelling. This is not accurate. In fact it was the dinosaurs, and not the people, who were time traveling.</del></p> <p><ins><mark>Correction:</mark> A recent update to my story implied that a group of people were killed by time travelling dinosaurs. Neither the story nor the update made it clear that this is only one of several theories currently being considered. The exact circumstances remain a mystery. However, rumor has it that the group of people died becasue of a lack of H<sub>2</sub>0.</ins></p> </ins>
